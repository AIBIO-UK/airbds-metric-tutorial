# Contributing to the AIRBDS AI-Readiness Dataset Scoring Metric

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how to
contribute to the **AIRBDS AI-Readiness Dataset Scoring Metric** — a versioned,
machine-readable framework for assessing the AI-readiness of bioscience
datasets, developed by the
[AI-Ready Bioscience Datasets (AIRBDS) working group](https://aibio.ac.uk/about/working-groups/airbds/)
of the AIBIO-UK network.

We primarily use a GitHub-based workflow. Contributions are made via Pull
Requests (PRs) which are reviewed and merged by the working group maintainers.

## Ways to Contribute

### Submitting Dataset Reviews

The primary contribution type is a completed dataset review scored using the
AIRBDS metric.

1. **Copy the template:** Start from
   [`metric/review_template.yaml`](metric/review_template.yaml).
2. **Name your file:** Use the convention
   `reviews/<dataset_accession>_<reviewer_initials>_<n>.yaml`  
   e.g. `reviews/E-MTAB-1234_CH_1.yaml`
3. **Fill in all fields:** Answer all 28 questions ("Yes" or "No"). For Ethics
   questions (ACM-24 to ACM-28), if the dataset contains no human or animal
   subject data record the answer as `"Yes"` and set `not_applicable: true`
   with a brief comment.
4. **Calculate your score:** Use the weights in
   [`metric/scoring_schema.yaml`](metric/scoring_schema.yaml). Record the total
   weighted score and grade in the `result` block.
5. **Submit a PR** — see [Pull Requests](#pull-requests).

Inter-rater reliability is important. Where possible, datasets should be
reviewed independently by at least two members before the review is merged.

### Proposing Metric Changes

Changes to the metric (new questions, reworded questions, new guidance,
weighting adjustments) should be proposed via a GitHub Issue before a PR is
opened. This ensures discussion and working-group consensus before any change
is committed.

**Before proposing a change:**
- Check open and closed Issues to avoid duplicates.
- Consult the [Versioning Policy](#versioning-policy) to understand how your
  proposed change will affect the version number.

**When opening an Issue for a metric change:**
- Use the title prefix `[Metric Change]`
- State which question(s) are affected (e.g. `ACM-12`)
- Describe the rationale for the change and any evidence or references that
  support it
- Indicate whether the change is: guidance-only (PATCH), question rewording
  (MINOR), or weight/threshold change (MAJOR)

---

### Reporting Issues

If you find an error, broken link, or inconsistency anywhere in the repository:

1. **Check existing issues** to see if it has been reported.
2. **Create a new issue** with a clear title and description. Include:
   - The file and line/field affected
   - What the error is and what you expected
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)

---

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/add-review-E-MTAB-1234
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following the YAML formats described below.
3. **Validate your YAML** — ensure it is valid YAML:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('your_file.yaml'))"
   ```
4. **Commit your changes** using the [convention below](#commit-message-convention):
   ```bash
   git add reviews/E-MTAB-1234_CH_1.yaml
   git commit -m "review: add review for E-MTAB-1234 (CH)"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/add-review-E-MTAB-1234
   ```
6. **Open a PR** against the `main` branch. Provide:
   - A clear title and description
   - The dataset name and accession (for review PRs)
   - A summary of any metric changes proposed (for metric PRs)

## What to Contribute

- ✅ Completed dataset reviews (`reviews/*.yaml`)
- ✅ Corrections to existing reviews (factual errors, updated dataset versions)
- ✅ Proposed question additions, removals, or rewordings — via Issue first
- ✅ Guidance clarifications (PATCH-level) — directly as a PR
- ✅ Fixes for typos, broken links, or formatting errors
- ✅ Improvements to the README, CONTRIBUTING guide, or documentation

---

## What Not to Contribute

- ❌ Changes to the core metric YAML without prior working-group discussion
  (open an Issue first)
- ❌ Proprietary or closed datasets that cannot be publicly linked
- ❌ Reviews submitted in formats other than YAML (e.g. Excel, CSV)
- ❌ Changes to CI/CD or repository infrastructure without prior discussion
- ❌ Promotional content unrelated to AI-ready bioscience datasets

## File Structure & YAML Format

```
airbds-metric/
├── metric/
│   ├── airbds_metric_v0.3.yaml   # Canonical metric definition (questions, weights)
│   ├── scoring_schema.yaml       # Grade thresholds and scoring rules
│   └── review_template.yaml      # Blank template for new reviews
├── reviews/                      # Completed dataset reviews (one file per review)
│   └── <accession>_<initials>_<n>.yaml
├── CITATION.cff
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
└── README.md
```

All metric and review files are YAML. Key rules:
- Use `"Yes"` or `"No"` (quoted strings) for all answer fields.
- Do not leave required fields blank in submitted reviews (use `""` only in
  the template).
- Follow the exact field names defined in `review_template.yaml`.
- Ensure all YAML is valid before submitting (see `python3 -c "import yaml; ..."` above).

## Versioning Policy

The metric follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
(**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**):

| Change type | Version bump |
|---|---|
| Guidance-only clarifications (no change to question meaning) | PATCH |
| Question additions, deletions, or rewordings that change meaning | MINOR |
| Changes to scoring weights or grade thresholds | MAJOR |

The canonical metric file is versioned in its filename
(e.g. `airbds_metric_v0.3.yaml`). When a new version is released:
1. The new YAML file is added (e.g. `airbds_metric_v1.0.yaml`)
2. The old file is kept for archival purposes
3. `CHANGELOG.md` is updated
4. A GitHub Release is tagged (e.g. `v1.0.0`)
5. `CITATION.cff` is updated with the new version

Existing dataset reviews reference the metric version they were scored against
via the `schema_version` field.

## Commit Message Convention

Use the following prefixes for clarity:

| Prefix | Use for |
|---|---|
| `review:` | Adding or updating a dataset review |
| `metric:` | Changes to the metric YAML |
| `docs:` | Documentation changes (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.) |
| `fix:` | Typo, broken link, or formatting fix |
| `chore:` | Repo infrastructure (CI, .gitignore, etc.) |
| `release:` | Version bump and release preparation |

Example: `review: add review for ArrayExpress E-GEOD-12345 (CH)`

## Review Process

Working group maintainers will review all Pull Requests.

- We aim to respond within **14 days**.
- Feedback may be provided via PR comments; please respond or revise promptly.
- For dataset reviews: a second independent review is encouraged before merging.
- For metric changes: working-group consensus (via the linked Issue) is required
  before merging.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge into `main`.
